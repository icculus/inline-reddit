It feels like I spend about half my day doing this in Google Reader:

<p>
<img src='oooh-that-looks-interesting.png'/>

<p>
Oooh, that looks <i>extremely</i> interesting! <b>*click*</b>

<p>
Naturally, it's this bullshit every damned time:

<p>

<p>
...so I find myself with 156 browser tabs waiting for me to spend some
attention. This takes 14 hours to go through. By the time I get to the last
one, I can't even remember which unrelated reddit subject line this lolcat was
paired with, since the postings tend to have really specific text, like
"*sigh*" or "this blew my mind."

<p>
To solve this, I introduce: inline reddit.

<p>
What this does: it takes the reddit RSS feeds, and rewrites them. The images
and videos linked to by a given reddit article are now placed in the article
itself, so you have the content right in front of you.

<p>
To use it, point your feed reader here:
<a href="feed/">
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/
</a>

<p>
<strike>I use it with <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a></strike>, but it
should work with any feed catcher.

<p>
<b>subreddits:</b> You get them like this:
<a href="feed/?subreddit=AskReddit">
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/?subreddit=AskReddit
</a>

<p>
<b>sorting:</b> You want "top" or "hot" or "controversial", etc?<br/>
<a href="feed/?subreddit=AskReddit/top">
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/?subreddit=AskReddit/top
</a>
<br/>
<a href="feed/?subreddit=AskReddit/hot">
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/?subreddit=AskReddit/hot
</a>
<br/>
<a href="feed/?subreddit=AskReddit/controversial">
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/?subreddit=AskReddit/controversial
</a>

<p>
<b>multireddits:</b> You get them like this:
<a href="feed/?multireddit=redditpets&user=reddit">
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/?multireddit=redditpets&amp;user=reddit
</a>

<p>
<b>private feeds:</b> You get the feed info <a href="http://www.reddit.com/prefs/feeds/">here</a>, and use it like this:<br/>
http://inline-reddit.com/feed/?feed=&lt;some_sha1_looking_hash&gt;&amp;user=&lt;your_reddit_login_name&gt;<br/>
<b>DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.</b><br/>
This means we'll be republishing possibly-personal information.<br/>
If you give these URLs to Google Reader, they will be discoverable by search.</br>
If you change your password, the URLs will change too, but Google Reader caches any old feed items forever.
